> **General information about Pixhawk designs, schematics, reference hardware, FMU versions, licensing, and trademarks, and contributing to the project can be found in the repo [README](../README.md).**

The open hardware design of Pixracer (based on FMUv4) is provided [here](https://github.com/AUAV-OpenSource/FMUv4-PixRacer).

## Design Files

The design is provided in [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/) CAD files.

It consists of schematic files (*.SchDoc), BOM listings, and includes open reference hardware PCB layouts (.PrjPcb). 

> **Tip** PDF versions of the schematics and PCB layouts has been made available for easy previewing (i.e. if you don't have Altium Designer).
